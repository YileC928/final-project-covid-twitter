# Goals: 

2020 is all about Covid-19. This unprecedented global pandemic has changed everyone's daily normal and we are willing to find out what CDC news relates to the change of the number of covid infected persons and death. In the meantime, in the United States, many governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York State will give covid administration on Twitter. We would also collect data from several states seriously influenced by Covid. If time permits, we would collect data from all states' governors. We would build a web interaction page (probably using flask) that when users input a time period and state name, they can see the covid number and CDC & governors policy guidelines and covid-related policies.
